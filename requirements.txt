## Project Dependencies and Setup

This document outlines the steps required to set up the necessary environment and install the dependencies for the chatbot project.

### 1. Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following software installed:

* Python: Version 3.x (recommended: 3.8 or higher)
* pip: Python's package installer (usually included with Python)
* Virtual Environment (Optional but Highly Recommended):  `venv` (built-in) or `conda`

### 2. Creating a Virtual Environment (Recommended)

It's best practice to use a virtual environment to isolate project dependencies.

* Using `venv` (Python 3)

python3 -m venv .venv  # Create a virtual environment (replace .venv with your preferred name)
source .venv/bin/activate  # Activate the virtual environment (Linux/macOS)
.venv\Scripts\activate  # Activate the virtual environment (Windows)

3. Installing Dependencies
Once the virtual environment is activated (if you're using one), install the required packages using pip and the requirements.txt file.

Create requirements.txt: In the root directory of your project, create a file named requirements.txt.

Populate requirements.txt: Add the following dependencies to requirements.txt, one per line.  Specify versions if possible for better reproducibility.

langchain>=0.1.17  # Or pin to a specific version: langchain==0.1.18
llama-cpp-python>=0.1.77 # Or pin to a specific version: llama-cpp-python==0.1.78
psycopg2-binary # For PostgreSQL interaction (if used)
# Add other dependencies here (e.g., transformers, torch, etc.)
Install: Use the following command in your terminal (make sure the virtual environment is activated if you created one):

pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Running the Chatbot
After installing the dependencies, you can run the chatbot script.

python chatbot.py  # Replace chatbot.py with the name of your main script
5. Deactivating the Virtual Environment (When Finished)
When you're done working on the project, deactivate the virtual environment.

venv:
deactivate
